Simple wireless sensor system
=============================

As a part of home automation system for my house, I have designed a wireless sensors system that can continuously
monitor temperature, humidity, light and atmospheric pressure of multiple spots in the building.

This repository contains all elements required to build your own wireless sensor system based on ATmega328P, 
Raspberry PI and NRF24L01+.
