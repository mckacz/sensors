Each next digit of value that you entering must be entered within 5 seconds after previous one.
Each number can be ended/confirmed by any non-digit character (or you can wait 5 seconds). 
If selected command requires a few numbers, then separate them with any non-digit character.
Floating-point number can be entered as usual - with dot between digits. 

When you exit setup mode, the module will start its normal work cycle and will print on serial terminal current measurements.
When you power on the module and do not enter setup mode, serial terminal will be disabled.

Radio message format
--------------------

Communication between a module and a server is passive. Module only sends messages and server only receives messages.
Each message has the same format described by [`struct readings_t`](./sensor/sensor.h):
